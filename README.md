# Hexagon tile grid map generator
A script to convert homogeneously shaped/sized polygons to homogenous tessellated hexagons while retaining the overall shape of the larger geographic feature.

See the Jupyter Notebook file (_Hexagon Tile Grid Map Generator.ipynb_) for more details and a thorough explanation.

This code is young. I would love input on how to make it better. I would also love for you to use it or parts of it for your own fun.
